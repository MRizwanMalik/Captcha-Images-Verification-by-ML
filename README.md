# Captcha Verification Machine Learning Model

**Introduction**

Tired of manually solving CAPTCHAs? This project introduces a powerful machine learning model designed to automatically verify CAPTCHA images. 

**Features**
* Robust Model: Highly accurate in recognizing a wide range of CAPTCHA types.
* User-Friendly GUI: A simple Flask-based interface for easy image uploads and verification.
* Efficient Processing: Quick and reliable CAPTCHA verification.

**Getting Started**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your_username/captcha-verification](https://github.com/your_username/captcha-verification)


Set Up Environment:
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

TensorFlow/PyTorch (or your preferred deep learning framework)
Flask
OpenCV-Python
Other necessary libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
You can use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the Model (Optional):
If you want to train your own model, follow the instructions in the training directory.

Run the Flask App:

Bash

python app.py
Use the GUI:

Access the application in your web browser (usually at http://127.0.0.1:5000).
Upload a CAPTCHA image.
The model will process the image and display the predicted text.
